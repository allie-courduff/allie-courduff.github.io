### Education
  I am a UMBC undergraduate alumni, majoring in geography and environmental science. I am currently enrolled in UMBC's Master's Thesis Program, majoring in Geography and Environmental Studies. My thesis focus is on oyster restoration in Maryland, how this work differs between state and non-state organizations, and how the goals of this restoration can shift through project planning and placement. Additional work experience is provided under the CV tab.
    
 ### Master's Thesis    
  I am planning to incorpate a mix of qualitative and quantitaive methods, interviewing both organizations of interest to learn both their purpose and priorities of oyster restoration goals as well as their decision-making processes. With this information, I want to create and analyze maps that compare each group's oyster restoration data with various socioeconomic and environmental variables, to see if there is a spatial relationship that could relate to the groups' goals. I will then return for a second interview with officials to share my findings and go over their significance, allowing for a portion of co-production in my analyses.

### Interests
  My interests in GES include: critical mapping, ecology, the production of nature, and environmental policy and equity. Outside of academia, I enjoy drawing (digital and traditional), gardening, fiber crafts, cooking, horror movies, and high fantasy books & games.
