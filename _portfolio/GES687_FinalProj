The primary goal of the advanced GIS course for both undergrads and graduate students at UMBC is for students to improve/hone their skills in R code manipulation as in map-making programs, such as QGIS and Geoda. Over the course of the semester, students refine these skills with the end-goal of ease in making professional looking maps and code.

Lab 5, occurring in the middle of the semester, worked primarily to build our ability to produce readable maps in RStudio, without having to even work in a mapping program like QGIS or ArcGIS Pro. One of the maps I produced is included below, with the code used to produce it.
