The primary goal of the advanced GIS course for both undergrads and graduate students at UMBC is for students to improve/hone their skills in R code manipulation as in map-making programs, such as QGIS and Geoda. Over the course of the semester, students refine these skills with the end-goal of ease in making professional looking maps and code.

Lab 5, occurring in the middle of the semester, worked primarily to build our ability to produce readable maps in RStudio, without having to even work in a mapping program like QGIS or ArcGIS Pro. One of the maps I produced is included below, with the code used to produce it.

This map and coding chunk - while not perfect - was an exercise in building my skill in R, and learning all its utilities. Prior to this course, I didn't even know R could produce this level of specified maps. While my map has some issues in its presentation - longitude values all scrunched together, default font and display - it succeeded as an end-product while still being in an intermediate time in the course. The final map produced in this course showcases a greater control of mapping programs and professional presentation, but maps and coding exercises like those shown above were crucial to get to that improved final product.
